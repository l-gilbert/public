<h2 id="combining-fields-skills">Combining Fields/Skills</h2>

<p>I believe Scott Adams and Marc Andreeson have advocated the same idea: that it is valuable to be good (though probably not exceptional) at two or three or four things. Because of diminishing returns to practice and the comparative difficulty of finding brilliant mentors/getting into elite grad schools/committing several years to a single endeavor, it is probably generally easier to get good at a few separate things than to optimize along a single dimension.</p>

<p>Or to put it another way, it is probably easier to optimize along an uncommon or unseen dimension than to attempt greatness along a well-trodden path. Tyler Cowen mentioned this when interviewed by Patrick Collison: George Mason University&rsquo;s economics department isn&rsquo;t Harvard, but it&rsquo;s not trying to be - it&rsquo;s wonderful and fascinating in its own way.</p>

<p>The trick, then, is to find a couple fields/skills that can complement each other nicely. Two things:
a) this is probably not much of a constraint. It may take you a while to find connections between your interests, but my guess is that they&rsquo;re there.
b) developing a handful of skills is not the same as being a total generalist. Instead, (at least if you brand it properly) you&rsquo;ll be an expert in an altogether new domain.</p>

<p>One way to actually make this happen would be to do multiple master&rsquo;s degrees. Since most master&rsquo;s programs are expensive (unfunded, unlike many PhD&rsquo;s), it makes sense that people don&rsquo;t do this. But if you were able to get some funding, you could finish two master&rsquo;s programs in at most four years (i.e. at least a year shorter than a PhD). It seems like good candidates would be fields that are not-quite-adjacent, like physics and biology, or economics and computer science, or statistics and public policy, or law and education, or marketing and sociology, or fine art and psychology, or math and management, or whatever.</p>

<h2 id="entangling-consumption-and-production">Entangling Consumption and Production</h2>

<p>For the academic, journalist, or other infovore, it seems there is a perpetual tension between media production and consumption. Production builds your career in the short-term but consumption (learning) is necessary to sustain long-term growth. I&rsquo;m not sure how much control over the balance of these two people actually have in practice, but it would be nice to know what the optimal mix is and what factors it depends on.</p>

<p>One practical solution is to set quotas to spend a quarter or a third of your time on each, and allocate the remainder according to the demands and whims of the day. Another is to select and design projects such that production and consumption are inextricable - the new thing you&rsquo;re producing requires you to learn something new as well.</p>

<p>Some other thoughts on how to best consume media. First, quality becomes increasingly important as quantity (length) scales. This means that, relative to the number you start, you should finish fewer books than podcasts or articles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reading&rdquo; can be done at varying levels of depth/speed, and the goal is not to reach the greatest depth, but to choose the depth appropriate for your needs. If you need to get a feel for an academic field, you could read the abstracts and conclusions of 100 papers in under 10 hours. If you need to replicate a paper to build off of it, you might read the whole thing and correspond with the authors over a period of weeks. Either approach would be stupid if applied to the opposing objective.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how curiosity really works, but it generally seems like a good idea to follow it. At the very least, you&rsquo;ll cover more ground following the thing you&rsquo;re interested in than by slogging through the thing you&rsquo;re &lsquo;supposed&rsquo; to do. Of course you sometimes need to discipline yourself, but when you don&rsquo;t&hellip;don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>In sum: dip into what excites you and run from there. If you get tired before finishing, take a break and come back later.</p>
