<main>
<p>A matching market is one in which parties have to be personally matched to each other because they have preferences about whom they transact with; a market price alone is insufficient to determine who should interact with whom. Examples include employees &amp; firms, graduate students &amp; advisors, and romantic partners.</p>

<p>Another example is professional collaborators - e.g. scientists or artists whose interests and skills complement each other. Of the three examples above, one (graduate students &amp; advisors) features few options available to both parties. But the other two are large markets, and large companies have been created to facilitate the matching - LinkedIn, Tinder, etc.</p>

<p>Are there similar tools for &lsquo;independent agents&rsquo; - academics, writers, entrepreneurs, artists, etc. to meet and work with others like them? If not, it seems like there&rsquo;s a big opportunity here.</p>

<p>Another example: matching research methods and techniques to interesting questions and problems. This &lsquo;market&rsquo; is constantly running in the brain of every academic.</p>
