<main>
<p>Take the network of websites, where each node is a site and each link is a&hellip;hyperlink. A handful of sites (Facebook, Google, Amazon) have an enormous number of links to them, while most sites have only a handful of links. To be more precise, the degree distribution follows a power law, i.e. $f(x) \propto x^{-k}$ for some value of k. The question arises: why are the degrees distributed in this way? One mechanism proposed is preferential attachment: new sites preferentially attach to existing hubs. This is the basic idea behind the Barabasi-Albert model, which is an algorithm used to generate random graphs.</p>

<p>I wanted to run the Barabasi-Albert model on my own machine to test the degree distribution that it generates. There is an implementation of the model in Python using the NetworkX package, but for my purposes today I needed to rewrite it myself.<br />
First we import the required packages:</p>

<pre><code>import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random as rd
</code></pre>

<p>Next I define a function which will return the degree distribution of an input graph as a list.</p>

<pre><code># Computes the degree distribution of an input graph
def Distribution(graph): 
    DegreeList = sorted([d for n, d in graph.degree()])  

    degreeCount = [0]*(max(DegreeList)+1)
    for n in DegreeList:
        degreeCount[n] = degreeCount[n] + 1 

    degreeDistribution = [n * (1/float(len(DegreeList))) for n in degreeCount]
    return degreeDistribution
</code></pre>

<p>The next function runs the BA model itself and is the most complex piece of the code. You&rsquo;ll notice that the function returns several items - the degree distributions of three graphs, the average clustering coefficient over time, and a tracker of the degree of select nodes over time. The standard implementation of the model in NetworkX makes it difficult or impossible to access or compute all of this data, which is why I needed to write my own implementation.</p>

<pre><code>G = nx.complete_graph(4)

# Implements the Barabasi-Albert model. 
# Returns the degree distribution of the graph at select points and tracks degree dynamics. 
# DistributionPoints is a list of time steps at which to compute the degree distribution.
def BA_Model(N, m, InitialGraph, DistributionPoints):
    G = InitialGraph
    # Create list where the nth entry holds the degree of the nth node
    DegreeList = [3,3,3,3]
    # Initialize lists for tracking degree dynamics, degree distribution, and average clustering coefficient later
    Degrees0 = [3]
    Degrees100 = []
    Degrees1000 = []
    DegreeDistributions = []
    AvgClustering = []    
    
    # Add new nodes and preferentially attach to existing nodes    
    for n in range(m,N):
        # Add new node to graph
        G.add_node(n)
        # Randomly select nodes for new node to attach to
        NewEdgeTargets = []
        NewEdgeTargets = np.random.choice(a = range(n), size = m, replace = False, p = [i/float(sum(DegreeList)) for i in DegreeList]) 
        # Add to list to reflect that the newly-added node will have m connections
        DegreeList.append(m)
        
        # Update lists to reflect new edges
        for j in NewEdgeTargets:
            DegreeList[j] = DegreeList[j] + 1
            G.add_edge(n,j)
        
        # Compute and track average clustering coefficient
        AvgClustering.append(nx.average_clustering(G))
        
        # Compute and report the degree distribution at the desired time steps
        if n in DistributionPoints:
            DegreeDistributions.append(Distribution(G))
                            
        # Track degree of selected nodes over time
        Degrees0.append(DegreeList[0])
        if n &gt;= 100: 
            Degrees100.append(DegreeList[100])
        if n &gt;= 1000: 
            Degrees1000.append(DegreeList[1000])    
    
    return DegreeDistributions, AvgClustering, Degrees0, Degrees100, Degrees1000
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the relevant functions are defined, we can run the algorithm and plot the results:</p>

<pre><code># Run the algorithm and record the results
Results = BA_Model(2500,4,nx.complete_graph(4),[100,1000,2450])
         
# Define x and y variables for plotting degree distributions 
x1 = [i for i in range(len(Results[0][0]))]
y1 = Results[0][0]
x2 = [i for i in range(len(Results[0][1]))]
y2 = Results[0][1]
x3 = [i for i in range(len(Results[0][2]))]
y3 = Results[0][2]  


# Plot degree distribution and line of best fit with log-log scale
from matplotlib import style
style.use('ggplot')
plt.subplot(1,2,1)
plt.loglog(x1, y1, 'ro', x2, y2, 'bo', x3, y3, 'go')
plt.title(&quot;Degree Distribution&quot;)
plt.xlabel(&quot;k&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;p(k)&quot;)
plt.show() 


# Plot cumulative degree distribution
CumDegree1 = np.cumsum(y1)
CumDegree2 = np.cumsum(y2)
CumDegree3 = np.cumsum(y3)
plt.subplot(1,2,2)
plt.plot(x1,CumDegree1, 'ro', x2, CumDegree2, 'bo', x3, CumDegree3, 'go')
plt.title(&quot;Cumulative Degree Distribution&quot;)
plt.xlabel(&quot;k&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;Cumulative Frequency&quot;)
plt.show() 

   
# Plot average clustering coefficient over time
plt.figure()
plt.plot([i for i in range(len(Results[1]))], Results[1])
plt.title(&quot;Average Clustering Coefficient Over Time&quot;)
plt.xlabel(&quot;t&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;Average Clustering Coefficient&quot;)
plt.show()


# Plot degree dynamics over time
plt.figure()
x_1 = [i for i in range(len(Results[2]))]
x_2 = [i for i in range(len(Results[3]))]
x_3 = [i for i in range(len(Results[4]))]
plt.plot(x_1, Results[2], 'ro', x_2, Results[3], 'bo', x_3, Results[4], 'go')
plt.title(&quot;Degree of Selected Nodes Over Time&quot;)
plt.xlabel(&quot;t&quot;)
plt.ylabel(&quot;k&quot;)
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>Below, you can see the plots generated. The first shows the degree distribution, $p(k),$ on a log-log plot. The different colors are for graphs with 100, 1000, and 2500 nodes. The plot is obviously linearish, suggestive of a power law distribution. Next to that plot you&rsquo;ll see the cumulative degree distribution, which clearly shows that most of the nodes have &lt;20 links while at least one node has 160+ edges.</p>

<p>Here we have the average clustering coefficient over time. The seed graph is $K_4,$ so naturally the coefficient starts at 1. But as more edges are preferentially added, the develops a handful of large hubs but little community structure; the clustering coefficient reflects this change.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the trajectory of selected nodes over time. These nodes were added at different times - hence the green and blue lines stopping short of the full 2500 iterations of the algorithm. The red node had more time to add links, and this is reflected in the graph below.</p>
