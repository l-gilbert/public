<p>If laws are the rules of the game of life, then crafting those laws is the process of designing a particular type of game. The question then becomes - what kind of game would you like to play? Or perhaps, what kind of game <strong>should</strong> you like to play? Or even, what kind of game do you think other people would like to play? In any case, this perspective is less emotionally-laden than political discussions often are. It also points to the role of economists - i.e. the people who actually know game theory and mechanism design - in formulating reasonable policies. It seems that many people have opinions on many topics without understanding the underlying economics; this is problematic. Moreover, professional pundits are given much airtime and columnspace in the popular media. Some have JDs but few seem to have economics PhDs. This makes sense as the outcome of a free market - economists as a group are less likely to enjoy the writing- and socially-intensive work of journalism, but it&rsquo;s still a shame. We could use more professional game designers explaining how the game works.</p>
