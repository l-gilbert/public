      <description>Combining Fields/Skills I believe Scott Adams and Marc Andreeson have advocated the same idea: that it is valuable to be good (though probably not exceptional) at two or three or four things. Because of diminishing returns to practice and the comparative difficulty of finding brilliant mentors/getting into elite grad schools/committing several years to a single endeavor, it is probably generally easier to get good at a few separate things than to optimize along a single dimension.</description>

      <title>Matching Market Examples</title>

      <description>A matching market is one in which parties have to be personally matched to each other because they have preferences about whom they transact with; a market price alone is insufficient to determine who should interact with whom. Examples include employees &amp;amp; firms, graduate students &amp;amp; advisors, and romantic partners.
Another example is professional collaborators - e.g. scientists or artists whose interests and skills complement each other. Of the three examples above, one (graduate students &amp;amp; advisors) features few options available to both parties.</description>

      <title>Policymaking as Game Design</title>

      <description>If laws are the rules of the game of life, then crafting those laws is the process of designing a particular type of game. The question then becomes - what kind of game would you like to play? Or perhaps, what kind of game should you like to play? Or even, what kind of game do you think other people would like to play? In any case, this perspective is less emotionally-laden than political discussions often are.</description>

      <title>Folk Wisdom</title>

      <description>There are a great number of aphorisms in the English language, each containing a piece of time-tested wisdom. I sifted through hundreds, mostly listed on Wikipedia, and organized the ones I found interesting. Unsurprisingly, many are prescriptions re: how to be successful/live a good life, and I&amp;rsquo;ve divided those according to whether they are more applicable to individuals or groups. Others, as stated, are merely descriptions of human nature/external reality, but many of these contain an unspoken implication, and so are effectively prescriptions as well.</description>

      <description>Pick an object of your interest, hypothetical or real. Ignoring costs, there is only one sensible way to interact with that object: improve it. If it is not yet real, build it. If it is real but unfinished, finish it. If it is damaged, repair it. If it is causing harm, destroy it. If it&amp;rsquo;s perfect (is it?), leave it be.
&amp;mdash;Pick a Problem&amp;mdash; Because initiative is scarce, any of these acts will be high value.</description>

      <description>This is a curation of the highlights from some lecture notes by Ole Peters and Alexander Adamou.
Defining Ergodicity Classical economics is based on the assumption that the rational economic decision is the one that maximizes the actor&amp;rsquo;s expected value. And indeed, individuals should act to maximize something, but expected value is not quite that something. The expected value measures what happens across individuals, but individuals want to know what will happen across time.</description>

      <description>This code accompanies two datasets on the effects of 10,000 SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on two traits, A and B. Each dataset includes an ID number indicating the location of the SNP on the chromosome, the two alleles (A, T, C, or G) that occur in that position, the frequency with which the alleles occur, an estimate of the effect size of the SNP on trait A or B, and the z-score produced when the null hypothesis (that the given SNP has no effect on the given trait) was tested.</description>

      <title>Simulating Voting in a Legislative Body</title>

      <description>It is interesting to consider what determines the outcome of roll-call votes in legislative bodies. There are likely many interconnected factors, including lobby influence, political deals, demands from the constituents, and media portrayals. In this post I’m going to ignore all of those factors and model voting based on just one dimension at a time: liberal/conservative (i.e. left/right) or conservative/progressive (i.e. resistant to or enthusiastic about change). In later posts maybe we can incorporate other factors and/or compare this model to real voting behavior.</description>

      <title>Categorizing Probability Distributions</title>

      <description>There are two fundamental tasks one might use statistics for: 1. Predicting outcomes. You have a model of a how a process works and want to know what sort of data it will generate. 2. Understanding outcomes. You have data and want to know what sort of model generated it. We can use these tasks to guide our organization of common probability distributions.
1. Predicting Outcomes (model known, data unknown) Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first task: model is known; data is not.</description>

      <description>Take the network of websites, where each node is a site and each link is a&amp;hellip;hyperlink. A handful of sites (Facebook, Google, Amazon) have an enormous number of links to them, while most sites have only a handful of links. To be more precise, the degree distribution follows a power law, i.e. $f(x) \propto x^{-k}$ for some value of k. The question arises: why are the degrees distributed in this way?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a master&amp;rsquo;s student in the Economics department at Tufts University and have a B.A. in Mathematics from Pomona College.
I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using the most powerful tools available - markets, statistics, computers, and narratives - to dramatically improve the way we manage, process, and apply information and attention. There are many manifestations of this theme; see Q &amp;amp; H for more details.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in collaborating on or discussing something in Q &amp;amp; H, please contact me at logan [dot] gilbert [at] tufts [dot] edu.</description>

      <description>This page was inspired by Patrick Collison’s page.
The standard pairing is Q &amp;amp; A, but when you’re working on the frontier, it’s more natural for a question to be coupled to a hole - something missing in society - than to an answer. These are some questions and holes that I’d like to answer/fill.
