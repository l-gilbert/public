<p>Pick an object of your interest, hypothetical or real.
Ignoring costs, there is only one sensible way to interact with that object: improve it.
If it is not yet real, build it.
If it is real but unfinished, finish it.
If it is damaged, repair it.
If it is causing harm, destroy it.
If it&rsquo;s perfect (is it?), leave it be.</p>

<h3 id="pick-a-problem">&mdash;Pick a Problem&mdash;</h3>

<p>Because initiative is scarce, any of these acts will be high value.
But there are heuristics which will help you further your value-added.</p>

<p>Your problem selection will be a function of both the world (what does it badly need?) and of you (what are you able and excited to provide?). Let&rsquo;s consider how to answer each question on its own and then how to weld them together.</p>

<p>The world has many problems, but not all of them should weigh equally in your mind because they do not weigh equally on the people experiencing them. Unquenched thirst for water is a more pressing problem than a parched curiosity. And 10,000 thirsty people is worse than 10 thirsty ones. So consider the scale and severity of problems as your first decision criterion. Bigger is better.</p>

<p>A note on finding big problems. Some problems are easy to spot, because they&rsquo;re plastered over every media outlet in the world. Others are insidious and subtle, either because they&rsquo;re the root causes of other problems, or because they&rsquo;re so deeply baked into our societal structure that we can&rsquo;t see them. Such problems are more valuable to discover because they&rsquo;re neglected.</p>

<p>So you should look for big problems, but in particular you need to find ones that you have a fighting chance at solving. You must know both what interests you and what your comparative advantage is, which in turn requires you to <em>have</em> a comparative advantage. Meeting that requirement is nontrivial because it requires nonconformism. By definition, your comparative advantage is where you excel <em>compared to other people</em>. It is hard to develop such a thing in a cohort where everyone else is learning the same skill. So it is not really your fault if you&rsquo;re at stage $s$ of your life and don&rsquo;t have much to offer over the next fella.</p>

<p>But you should work to change that. Read, listen to podcasts, watch videos, talk to people, write, reflect. Get really good at something, or maybe not-quite-really good at two somethings.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve spent some time (months, years) studying the world&rsquo;s flaws and building your own skills, your problem will probably reveal itself to you. It will just be clear what the most impactful, engaging thing to work on is.</p>

<p>Unfortunately many people will never make it to that revelation because they optimize prematurely. This is natural. For one, there is a tendency to shy away from big problems, either consciously <a href="http://paulgraham.com/schlep.html">or not.</a> And two, it can be quite anxiety-inducing for an ambitious person to not &lsquo;have things figured out&rsquo;, especially when their friends are climbing corporate ladders like it&rsquo;s 3rd grade recess.</p>

<p>The antidote to these forces is to breathe deeply and zoom out. Three-year mountains are ten-year stepping stones. It is probably more valuable to work on one 10-year project than two 5&rsquo;s or five 2&rsquo;s.  There are <em>increasing</em> returns to specialization which you can only access through long-term commitment. You also avoid transition costs: time, money, energy spent idly or vetting new endeavors. But you&rsquo;ll never persist for a decade unless you&rsquo;re damn sure the project is worthwhile. So explore with fervor early on lest you commence with doubts still lingering. Your path will be clearer and smoother this way.</p>

<h3 id="strategize-and-execute">&mdash;Strategize and Execute&mdash;</h3>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve wed yourself to a problem, it is time to figure out how to solve it. This is a process. Planning a large endeavor takes time, more time than planning a vacation. So you may not have a relevant point of reference, and you might get frustrated and wonder if it&rsquo;s all necessary. But it takes as long as it takes; if there are unresolved strategic blocks, more work must be done.</p>

<p>It is difficult to give general strategic advice because so much strategy is context-dependent: your particular constraints, assets, and long-term goal all shape the specific strategy you&rsquo;ll use. Nevertheless, I can make a few general comments that should be applicable to many.</p>

<p>Save yourself some trouble - work smart. Minimize transition costs by creating large blocks of uninterrupted work time. Work 4 tens instead of 5 eights; fast; automate or execute chores in batches; ignore nonsense<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>There will be times when you believe the path forward is blocked. Invert! Consider how you might destroy your project; do the opposite. When in doubt, invest in more (human) capital.</p>

<h3 id="some-notes">&mdash;Some Notes&mdash;</h3>

<p>Although the process is presented as linear, selection, strategizing, and execution may happen concurrently or in iterated loops. Both methods lend you flexibility to changing circumstances. You might make quick, cheap cycles through the phases several times before settling on a moderately well-defined path. Or in a single day you might talk to your target users/audience to redefine your problem, meet with collaborators to strategize about the next 3 months, and work on the problem itself.</p>

<p>There is some risk of overplanning or underplanning relative to the amount of execution. The optimal ratio will be highly context-dependent; planning is less valuable in volatile environments. But in general one would expect the bias to skew towards execution as the project matures. You will inevitably discard parts of your plan, but having one in place is vital.</p>

<li id="fn:1">Ignorance, you may think, can only be bad. You think wrong. You will never know everything, and the distribution of information&rsquo;s value is centered close to zero. Willful ignorance, then, is not always morally repugnant. Employed properly, it is a necessary and powerful tool in your quest to build. Apply liberally and repeat as needed.
