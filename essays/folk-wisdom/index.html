<p>There are a great number of aphorisms in the English language, each containing a piece of time-tested wisdom. I sifted through hundreds, mostly listed on Wikipedia, and organized the ones I found interesting. Unsurprisingly, many are prescriptions re: how to be successful/live a good life, and I&rsquo;ve divided those according to whether they are more applicable to individuals or groups. Others, as stated, are merely descriptions of human nature/external reality, but many of these contain an unspoken implication, and so are effectively prescriptions as well.</p>

<h1 id="individual-success">Individual Success</h1>

<p>The general flow of advice in this realm is: be careful; take initiative and persevere; maintain balance between the previous two pieces of advice; accept the inevitability of failure.</p>

<h3 id="caution">Caution</h3>

<p>Good things come to those who wait.
Patience is a virtue.
Haste makes waste.
Marry at haste, repent at leisure.
Failing to plan is planning to fail.
Plans are useless; planning is essential.
Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.
Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong.
The best-laid schemes of mice and men often go awry.
Look before you leap.
Don’t put too many irons in the fire.
If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
Leave well enough alone.
Do not burn your bridges behind you.
Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.
Better safe than sorry.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.<br />
Half a loaf is better than no bread.<br />
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket.
He that goes a-borrowing, goes a-sorrowing.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Live to fight another day.</p>

<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>

<p>The early bird gets the worm.
He who hesitates is lost.
Time and tide wait for no man.
Fortune favors the bold.
Opportunity doesn’t knock twice.
Time is money.
Don’t put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
God helps those who help themselves.
Well begun is half done.
The child is father of the man.
A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
Better late than never.</p>

<h3 id="incremental-gains">Incremental Gains</h3>

<p>Every little bit helps.
Little strokes fell great oaks.
Penny, penny makes many.
Take care of the pennies and the pounds will take care of themselves.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Practice makes perfect.
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.
Waste not, want not.
See a penny and pick it up, all the day you will have good luck; see a penny and let it lay, bad luck you will have all day.</p>

<h3 id="perseverence">Perseverence</h3>

<p>Do not change horses in midstream.
A job that’s worth doing is worth doing right.
If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.
Where there’s a will there’s a way.
Fake it till you make it.
One swallow does not make a summer.
Rome wasn’t built in a day.
Do not cry over spilled milk; do not make mountains out of molehills.
It ain’t over til it’s over; only time will tell.</p>

<h3 id="judgment">Judgment</h3>

<p>Timing is everything.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Get while the getting’s good.
Cross the stream where it is shallowest.
Go with the flow.
First things first.</p>

<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>

<p>Moderation in all things.
The straw that broke the camel’s back.
Too much of a good thing.
Variety is the spice of life.</p>

<h3 id="failure-and-ergodicity">Failure and Ergodicity</h3>

<p>No guts, no glory; no pain, no gain; nothing ventured, nothing gained; to make an omelet, you have to break some eggs; what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.</p>

<p>Shit happens; things fall apart; the longest day must have an end; all good things must end; every tide has its ebb; if you laugh before breakfast you’ll cry before supper; you can’t win them all; every dog has his day.</p>

<p>The bigger they are, the harder they fall.</p>

<p>What you lose on the swings you gain on the roundabouts.
Corollary: Every cloud has a silver lining.</p>

<h1 id="group-success">Group Success</h1>

<p>We start with some ground truths and rules about how groups do and should work, then move to communication (signaling), coordinated action, and markets.</p>

<p>Blood is thicker than water.
Corollary: East or West, home is best.
Birds of a feather flock together.

Corollary 3: There’s no such thing as a free lunch.
Corollary 4: Where there’s muck there’s brass.
Corollary 5: Do not cast your pearls before swine.</p>

Corollary, if the above is followed: A fool and his money are soon parted.</p>

<p>He who pays the piper calls the tune; to the victor go the spoils; if you want a thing done well, do it yourself.</p>
